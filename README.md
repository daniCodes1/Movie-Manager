# *My Personal Project*

## A Movie Manager Application

Hi there! This application is a *movie generator* that helps 
viewers choose a movie to watch. There will be questions about 
preferences that pop out in the beginning of the program that users can answer. 
These are meant to filter out movies based on specifications such as
genre, release date and movie length. Additionally, they will be able
to view a database that contains 50 movies for when they want to just browse around. 
Users can click on a movie to view a picture of the movie cover as well as a 
description of the movie. They will be able to add movies to their *favourites
album*, which contains movies they particularly enjoyed.

## Who is this for? And why?
This application is meant for people who want to watch a movie but are unsure what to watch, or people who
would like some new movie suggestions, which I'm **really** excited to share! 
I think that being able to input personal preferences can help users find movies that reflect their 
own interests and help this application reach a wider audience. My interest comes from 
seeing how films in general reflect culture and are a significant way of connecting to our own 
experiences with people and situations in life. As someone who really values human connections and 
social relationships, I think that a movie generator can serve as a stepping stone for people 
to find a movie that doesn't just entertain but **also communicates** with them in some way! 


## A summary of **user stories** for my project:

- *As a user, I want to be able to save my favourite movies
  into a “favourite album”*
- *As a user, I want to be able to input my movie preferences*
- *As a user, I want to be able to view a full database of 50 movies
  for when I don’t have a preference*
- *As a user, I want to be able to select a movie in my collection and
  view the movie cover and a description of the movie*
- *As a user, I want to be able to return to the homepage*
- *As a user, I want to be able to save the data in my favourites album, 
so I can reference back to it when I reload the application*
