# *My Personal Project*

## A Movie Manager Application

Hi there! This application is a *movie generator* that helps 
viewers choose a movie to watch. Users have the option to answer questions about their
preferences that pop out in the beginning of the program. 
These are meant to filter out movies based on specifications such as
genre and release date. Additionally, they will be able
to view a database that contains over 70 movies for when they want to just browse around. They will be
able to view and add movies to their *favourites  album*, which contains movies from my 
recommendation application that they particularly enjoyed.

## Who is this for? And why?
This application is meant for people who want to watch a movie but are unsure what to watch, or 
people who would like some new movie suggestions, which I'm **really** excited to share!
I think that being able to input personal preferences can help users find movies that reflect their 
own interests and help this application reach a wider audience. My interest comes from 
seeing how films in general reflect culture and are a significant way of connecting to our own 
experiences with people and situations in life. As someone who really values human connections and 
social relationships, I think that a movie generator can serve as a stepping stone for people 
to find a movie that doesn't just entertain but **also communicates** with them in some way!

  into a “favourite album”*
